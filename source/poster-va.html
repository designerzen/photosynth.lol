                    Rather than learning how to play a musical instrument, this musical instrument learns how to play
                    you! Use your facial expressions and movements to create pop music that is guided by your moods.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This accessible and inclusive music making activity will put a smile on your face and make it
                    musical!
                </p>

                <p>
                    This is a free, drop-in activity, suitable for all ages to enjoy together, where up to four people
                    collaborate to simultaneously make new music.
                    Each person gets the chance to be the star of their own song and act like a pop star. No booking is
                    required.
