                    The PhotoSYNTH is the result of a long term collaboration between Drake Music's legendary research and development team DMLab, and zen Olenski from Awesomething Social Enterprise. 
                    Together they have made magical musical bowler hats, beard organs, a whole lotta gloves, and various other experimental interfaces, some of which have ended up in the hands of disabled artists and musicians in studios, bedrooms and classrooms around the world.

                        How to convert emotions into music
                    </h4>
                </header>

                <p>Developments in science and research have resulted in exciting innovations that allow us to augment people's abilities in radical new ways using neural networking and machine learning.</p>
                    
                <p>Thanks to feedback loops that provide data to reinforce learning and artificial intelligence that is trained to recognise patterns, we now have the neccessary tools to make it possible to elegantly interface with machines in natural and intuitive new ways that constantly evolve, refine and improve the more they are used.</p>

                <p>The PhotoSYNTH, and other <abbr title="Accessible Musical Instrument Collection">AMIC</abbr> instruments, are developed from the ground up to be accessible and inclusive, with the support, training and feedback from hundreds of Disabled and differently-abled people. 
                This ensures that every step is a step forwards, towards improvement.</p>

                <p>By tracking your motions and emotions in real-time, the PhotoSYNTH converts your everyday movements into music and captures the subtleties and nuances of your expressions and performance.</p>

                <p>
                    An expressive musical instrument is at the zenith of complicated fidelity, some are incredibly complicated machines that require time to master.
                    The same techniques used to simplify the complex act of making music can be used for simplifying the control of other things.

                    <h4>How to read a human being</h4>
                </header>

                <p>Computers are very good at recognising patterns. 
                    If you keep showing a computer ducks, eventually it will realise what ducks have in common - a bill, wings, webbed feat, a distinct waddle and some quacks. 
                    With practice it becomes an expert it duck detection.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The same can be true for recognising human characteristics such as moods and emotions. 
                    Being happy presents many clues and indications when studied, most obvious is smiling, but joy also brings wide eyes, crows feet, and delight raises eyebrows.  
            
                    Frowns and furrowed brows indicate signs of melancholy and malaise.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Both happiness and sadness are easy to spot. Like ducks.

                    <h4>Unique Sonic characteristics - The Sound of Shapes</h4>
                </header>
            
                <p>
                    Each sound has a distinct shape, similar to a fingerprint or snowflake. 
                    This affects how it is perceived by your ears and how the sound travels and bounces off things. 
                  </p>
                    

                <p>Sound travels at the same speeds as gases do, because that is how they travel, they are gas powered. 
                </p>

                <p>
                 
                    Instead, variation in sound comes from their shape, their repetition and their strength. 
                    Tiny fragments of sound when repeated hundreds of times a second can create a musical sound similar to what an instrument might make.
                    We call these sound shapes timbres.
                    Timbres can be made from any fast repeating sound including noises.    
                </p>
          
                
                <p>
                    The frequency of the timbre, the rate that the noise rapidly repeats, dictates its unique sonic pattern and musical tone, which forms a note.
                    Each musical note is determined by the amount of times that the pattern repeats in a fixed time period, often refered to as its vibration, wavelength or frequency.
                </p>
      
                <p>
                    Different shapes affect the air as they travel as well as any physical matter encountered on the way, including vibrating the little hammers inside your ears, where these sonic bubbles tap dance the music directly into the brain to decode like morse code.
                </p>

                <p>Slow repeating sounds (low frequency) are perceived as deep or bassy, whist the faster they vibrate, the more high pitched they sound.</p>
                            
                <p class="pad-bottom" >

                </p>
                
                <!-- <p>Due to this extra detail in the higher frequencies, our brains can determine where they are coming from (their directionality) which is unlike bass that is omnipresent and all emcompassing.</p>  -->

                        <h4>Sonic characteristics of Sound</h4>
                    </header>

                    <p>As sound moves it leaves remnants of itself on things it touches, like sonic snail trails, vibrating and shedding frequencies and reverberations.</p>
                
                    <p>These collisions alter the acoustics and harmonics of the sound and add tone and character.</p>
                    
                    <p>When many notes exist in the same space they join together and form a new sound. Their waves double up or cancel out, creating entirely new waves and sounds. </p>

                    <p>Certain frequencies when played together, join up and form a chord, and if the notes are harmonic, and complement each other, can trigger strong emotional feelings in the person hearing them.</p>
                    <p class="pad-bottom">There are many different types of chords, but the most common ones in western music are the major and minor chords. 
                        Major chords sound happy, bright and cheerful, whereas minor chords can sound sad and somber yet compelling.</p>

                    <p class="pad-top wavey-top">There is much research into the topic of how sounds affect humans, but it is commonly thought that many of the emotional triggers caused by sound are rooted in our historic relationship with other people and animals. From the calming songs of the birds, or the purring of the pussycat, to the cries of a baby or the squeal of an animal in distress.</p>

                    <p>Many sounds have historical contexts that served an important role in our evolution as survival skills. We may never find out the true origins of these musical-emotional relationships, but they appear to be deeply entrenched and universal.</p>

                <div class="bg-children clip-overflow">
                    <p class="">Evocative sounds include the growl of a bear, the roar of a lion, bird song, the patter of rain and the clap of thunder. These all form part of the ecological audio landscape that has surrounded us for millenia, speaking to us long before we had a language.</p>  
                
                    <p>The dulset tones of "mumese" are universal, a high pithed, softer sounding way to communicate with children and cute animals. This inate skill also appears to be universal. Smaller things make higher pitched sounds, so we adopt these tones in an effort to communicate with them.</p>

                <p>When a musical note is played, the air pulses in patterns which is heard in our ears in the form of vibrations.</p>

                <p>All that music is, is repetition on many levels.</p>
                <p>Repetition forms music through many orders of magnitude, from the microspcopic vibrating patterns that form timbres, that at certain vibrations sound like notes, to the repetition of notes that form melodies, all the way up to the macroscopic patterns of repetition where the percussion forms rhythms and grooves.</p>

                <p>Our ears respond to repeating waves, and our brains yearn for patterns to discover, and information to decode.</p>

                    Everybody is different and unique. 
                    Some people have incredible memories and can vividly remember past events, whilst some people forget where they put their house keys every day. 
                    Some people remain laser focussed while others' brains begin to womble off.
                </p>

                    The diversity in human abilities has supported humanity by approaching problems from different perspectives and finding creative new ways of solving them.

                <p>
                    If everybody did the same things in the same fashion, 
                    everything would be a sea of uneventful nothingness, 
                    devoid of character, charm and appeal,  
                    where nothing new or exciting ever happens.

                <p>One area that has seen much research is using <em>neural networks and machine learning</em> to attempt to determine intentions from emotions and motions in realime, in order to augment existing skills with new musical abilities and super-powers.</p>
                <p>By piggybacking onto intrinsic movements, that come naturally, a performance can be both expressive and communicative, where the dance leads the music.
                    
                This could be as simple as binding musical actions to hand movements, or as sophisticated as a collaborative multiplayer face controlled pop-music factory that learns how to play you!</p>

                        Over 14 years, working directly with researchers, scientists, technologists, Disabled artists and even people with no musical abilities, #DMLab has been researching ways to grant musical superpowers through research and technology.

                    <p>
                        The DMLab workshop originally started in London over a decade ago and still runs today, but there is also now a Manchester branch. 
                        Bringing together people with technical knowledge and people with disabilities, and different abilities, to work together to research and develop new ways of interacting with technology in order to make music.
