        <p>The Summer Exhibition was a 6 day event held at the Royal Society over the summer of 2025.</p>
        <p>With over 12,000 visitors to the vvenue, we presented a multi-instrumental, immersive collaborative musical jam, demonstrating some of the instruments from the Accessible Musical Instrument Collection.</p>
      
        <p>In the evenenings, the Royal Society was host to their world-famous famous Soirees, the oldest scientific community meetup in recorded history dating back centuries. At these, notable dignitaries, royalty, scientists, politicians, and other very important people attended.</p>

            Central to the experience was the quartet version of the PhotoSYNTH:Sympathetic Synthesizer. 
            This immediately converted the crowd into musical instruments and their mods into music, 
            which gave a base for the other accessible musical instruments, which included the Orch Lab Touch Trombone and Harp as well as a demonstration from our resident popstar Noelle who demonstrated the Mimu gloves. 
            Working closely with ROLI, we demonstrated the musicasl theory behind the public's sounds using the new ROLI, lighting up the keys as the notes are played.

            The MIDI protocol, that sends and synchronises musical events, was used to connect all compatible musical instruments, allowing for the public to control hardware that was provided including a range of analogue synthesizers from KORG and Roland.
