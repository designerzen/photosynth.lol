        <p>
            Rather than learning how to play a musical instrument, this musical instrument learns how to play you! Use your facial expressions and your moods to create music. This accessible and inclusive music making activity will put a smile on your face and make it musical!
        </p>

        <p>Music making should be fun</p>

        <p>
            This is a free, drop-in activity, suitable for all ages to enjoy together, where up to four people collaborate to simultaneously make new music.  
            Each person gets the chance to be the star of their own song and act like a pop star. No booking is required.
        </p>

        <p>Activity developed by Zenon Olenski with support from Sound Connections, Drake Music and MASSIG.</p>
