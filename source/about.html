            <h1>Zenon Olenski</h1>
            <h2>Accessible Musical Instrument Collection</h2>
            <p>
                Hello! 
                The PhotoSYNTH is a magical synthesizer that allows you to make music with your smiles.
                It's a collaborative duet with Drake Music - a charity who for over 20 years have specialised in making accessible musical instruments.
            </p>
            <p>
                My name is zen and I've been making accessible and inclusive products for over two decades including a number of musical instruments for use by disabled artists.
                I've won numerous awards for my work and written papers on the research that I've conducted.
            </p>
            <p>
                By working alongside differently abled and disabled people, we've developed technology that levels the playing field for aspiring musicians of any ability, or lack thereof.
            </p>
            <p>
                Using mixed reality and custom designed software we discovered that it is possible to accelerate learning and simplify complex processes resulting in musical tools and instruments that can be used by everyone.
                The PhotoSYNTH and its holographic sibling were created for the Accessible Musical Instrument Collection - a museum of inclusive audio technology in central London here in the UK.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is a photo of the dreamCapturer, a machine that converts your dreams into soundtracks that works by reading your emotions in realtime.

                <h3>The Smile Powered Synthesizer!</h3>
                <h4>Introduction to the instruments</h4>
               
                <p>
                    The PhotoSYNTHs are a range of multiplayer, collaborative, mixed-reality POP-music factories that grant anyone nearby instant musical superpowers, and transforms any group of individuals into a pop-band!
                </p>
                
                <p>       
                    By tracking your motions and emotions in real-time, this magic mirror understands your moods and feelings, converting your everyday familiar movements and expressions into glorious music; where every articulation becomes an audio revelation!  
                    It is one of the easiest and most fun musical instruments to play—yet remains highly expressive, explorative and accessible.
                </p>
               
                <p>
                    Rather than playing a musical instrument, <em>the PhotoSYNTH learns how to play you!</em> 
                    <br>Without any training you can instantly make great music
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Finally, a purpose for your reflection!

                <h3>Profile</h3>

                <h4>3 second intro</h4>
                
                Helping you be.
                
                
                <h4>30 second intro</h4>
                
                From machines that convert dreams into soundtracks, through cybernetic interfaces giving plants the power to sing, to magical musical hats, sympathetic synthesizers and the most stealthy wearable instruments, zen from designerzen has been on a relentless 25-year mission bringing colourful sound solutions into everybody's worlds.
                
                
                <h4>3 minute intro</h4>
                
                Following in the family footsteps of releasing innovative audio products, zen set up designerzen as a company to combine technology, music, art and nature into uniquely creative concepts to empower individuals. His work spanning the last twenty five years covers many mediums, from online to physical, and has been presented in museums, exhibitions, arcades, festivals and even on your phone.
                
                designerzen's 2001 flagship product was the dreamCapturer - a wearable device that converts dreams into music. By recording biometrics and interpreting them with machine learning models trained on your own emotional states, each dream would create new musical composition, so that every night a unique soundtrack "quilt" of your dreams (and nightmares) is created which you can enjoy and share or confine to the vaults, never to be repeated again.
                
                Since then he has created bespoke products and installations for the public that mix technologies and arts in fun and creative ways, as well as giving talks on technology, the future and music. 
                
                His focus for the past few years has been to create musical instruments & music creation tools with the lowest barriers to entry - intuitive tools that everybody can play instinctively without any training. This passion led him to help start the DMLab monthly workshop over a decade ago which brings together technology makers and disabled artists, which has now grown to two monthly events including one at the School of Digital Arts (SODA) in Manchester.
                
                Together with Drake Music - a charity that specialises in accessible technology - and hundreds of disabled artists, they developed the award winning 'PhotoSynth : Pop Music Factory' series which allows anybody to make interactive songs just by moving around in front of their webcam.
                
                Using a grant from the British Council he created a magical Bowler hat that grants whomever wears it with instant musical talent and gives them a simple and fun way to make really expressive music using nothing more than movement. Due to COVID bringing everybody inside, online and apart from one another, it seemed like a good time to continue the idea and recreate the same experience but for an online audience, this time removing even the need for a hat!
                
                And so the PhotoSYNTH#InterFACE was born - an online, augmented reality, multiplayer synthesizer - or put simply, a smile powered, face controlled musical instrument and song creator with some added psychedelic visuals.
                
                If you would like to see more like this, be sure to check out DrakeMusic Lab #DMLab, and together help them create the next generation of musical instruments.

                <h4>3 second intro</h4>

                Instant Musical Superpowers!
                
                
                <h4>30 second intro</h4>
                
                This smile powered synthesizer grants you and your friends radical new musical superpowers!
                
                Rather than playing a musical instrument, the PhotoSYNTH plays you! By tracking your movements and emotions in real-time, this magic mirror converts them into beautiful music - making it one of the easiest and most fun synthesizers to play, alone or collaboratively with friends.
                
                Working alongside Drake Music Charity who specialize in accessible technology, and under the guidance of hundreds of disabled people, this multiplayer, collaborative mixed-reality pop music machine finally gives your reflection a purpose and empowers the broadest diversity of people to create expressive music... Instantly!  =D
                
                
                <h4>3 minute intro</h4>
                
                PhotoSYNTH is a multiplayer, collaborative Pop music machine that grants anyone nearby with radical musical superpowers!. 
                
                By observing your movements and emotions in realtime, the PhotoSYNTH tracks your natural movements, bestowing them with new musical abilities such as converting your smiles into musical notes. Without any training you can instantly make beautiful music using familiar movements, ensuring that the most diverse range of people can use it..
                
                Developed from the ground up with Drake Music Charity, specialists in accessible music technology, and hundreds of disabled artists who tested, tweaked and ultimately evolved the experience in order to make the world's most inclusive musical instrument. Constant testing with real people ensured that it evolved in an accessible and ergonomic way so that everyone can make music, alone or with friends, in or out of the metaverse. With the broadest demographic covering every diversity, the PhotoSYNTH levels the playing field for any aspiring musician.
                
                Looking like a magic mirror where you can see your own reflection, the PhotoSYNTH is a mixed reality audio synthesizer that uses realtime motion capture and facial landmark tracking to bring your movements, and the movements of your friends, to life - socially - controlling many aspects of each instrument and sound... Finally a use for your reflection!
                
                Collaboration is encouraged up to four people (quartet), and whilst playing alone is a lot of fun, bringing more players adds more layers to the music and amplifies the fun considerably, where each new person controls an appropriate lead instrument such as the guitar, bass or drums. It is the most satisfying and fun way to make music with your friends as nobody requires any previous skills or musical abilities... Plus it looks psychedelic! 
                
                Using industry standard MIDI connections, the PhotoSYNTH can talk to any modern electronic musical instrument and can control entire modular racks and even studios, leading it to win a MIDI Innovation award and being used in schools and studios around the world.
                
                Come and play with the holographic version at the Accessible Musical Instrument Collection (AMIC) in London, UK.
